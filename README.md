### What's up dude? ü§ôüèº

I'm a Software Engineering student currently working as a front-end developer at HP Inc. 

The technologies I use most in my work are JavaScript (React.js), HTML, CSS and Docker. 

But I also have experience with machine learning algorithms and some models of neural networks.

In love with technology, bussiness and people, I've been developing my career to work with Data Science.

Always looking for personal and professional development by making new connections and sharing experiences through teamwork.
